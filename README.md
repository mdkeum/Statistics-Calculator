## Project Overview

The **Statistics Calculator** is a simple tool designed to calculate key statistical metrics for any given dataset. This project provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input a set of numbers and quickly retrieve important statistical values like the **mean**, **median**, **mode**, **standard deviation**, and **variance**.

Whether you're working on data analysis, studying statistics, or just need to perform some quick calculations, this tool makes the process straightforward and accessible.
